## 🚧 What's Not Implemented Yet (TODO)

### 1. Full Book Generation
**Current state**: Only preview (1 page) is generated
**Needed**: Generate all pages (10-30) based on selections

**To implement**:
```python
# In payment.py webhook handler
def generate_and_send_book(session):
    # 1. Extract metadata from session
    # 2. Loop to generate X pages with AI
    # 3. Compile into PDF
    # 4. Send via email
```

### 2. Webhook Integration
**Current state**: Webhook logs payment but doesn't trigger generation
**Needed**: Call book generation on successful payment

**To implement**:
- Uncomment `generate_and_send_book(session)` in `payment.py` line 85

### 3. Colored Pages Generation
**Current state**: Only B&W generation works
**Needed**: Generate colored versions with user's selected colors

**To implement**:
- Modify prompt in `generated_image.py` to generate colored versions
- Use `colors` from selections metadata

### 4. Database for Orders
**Current state**: No order persistence
**Needed**: Store orders in SQLite/PostgreSQL

**To implement**:
- Create `database.py` with SQLAlchemy
- Store: order_id, customer_email, status, pdf_path, etc.

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ All API keys are in `.env` (not committed to Git)
✅ `.gitignore` includes `.env`
✅ Stripe keys are in test mode
✅ Webhook signature verification ready (needs STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)

- **Physical Book**: $24.99 USD

## 🌍 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Complete Book Generation
- Implement full multi-page generation
- Test with different themes/styles/difficulties

### 2. Test Email Delivery
- Verify Resend domain
- Test PDF email attachment
- Test physical book confirmation

### 3. Setup Webhook Properly
- Install Stripe CLI
- Get webhook secret
- Add to `.env`

### 4. Switch to Live Mode
- Get Stripe account approved
- Switch to `pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...`
- Update URLs for production domain

### 5. Deploy
- Deploy backend to Railway/Render
- Deploy frontend to Vercel
- Update environment variables

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start:
```bash
cd aipart
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Payment button doesn't work:
- Check console for errors
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check `.env` has correct Stripe keys

### Webhook not triggering:
- For local testing, webhooks need Stripe CLI
- In production, configure in Stripe Dashboard
